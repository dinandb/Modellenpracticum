heave_split, divide_data, predicint QP's logres, errors, evaluate and getMaxVals are functions
heave_split makes the lookbackwindow
divide_data splits the data into 80 % training data and 20 % test data
predicting QP's logres is the training model glm
errors has differnt loss functions defined
evaluate optimizes the loss functions
getMaxVals creates heave extrema

To use this, first run all the functions, then run DetectQP en data import. Now all the data is prepaired
Then run the function in evaluate which you want to use
It is prepared to use the heave amplitude
When you want to use the heave extrema, run "relevant_sim_data <- getMaxVals (relevant_sim_data)" after running DetectQP en data import
When you want to use heave velocity, change z_wf into z_velocity in heave_split and predicting QP's logres
